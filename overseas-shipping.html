<h6>MOVING OVERSEAS BY SEA FREIGHT</h6>
<h5>How are my belongings moved by sea freight?

</h5>
<h6>Most overseas moves are conducted through shipping in sea freight containers. Depending on the size of the move and the speed with which the move items are to arrive at your destination.</h6>
<p>There are two main sizes of shipping containers that you can consider, 20 foot which holds approximately 30 cubic meters (average 3 bedroom home), and 40 foot which holds approximately 60 cubic meters (average 4-5 bedroom home).
<br>
There are a number of container usage options available when moving personal effects via Sea Freight;
</p>


<h6>Full Container Load – FCL</h6>
<p>If you require a Full Container Load to yourself then you will use the FCL method which allows for direct shipping of your goods in your own dedicated container.
</p>
<h6>Groupage</h6>
<p>Allows you to share the cost of a container with other people moving personal effects to the same destination which is in a high volume area.
</p>

<h6>Less than Container Load – LCL
</h6>
<p>Less than Container Load method allows you to send smaller shipments to low volume destinations that don't have regular groupage services, by co-loading with commercial cargo shared containers subject to suitable protection, e.g. crating.
</p>
<p>If you are seeking a faster moving method then why not try moving by air freight.
</p>

<h6>MOVING OVERSEAS BY AIR FREIGHT</h6>

<h5>How fast can I move overseas?</h5>
<p>

If you require your personal effects to be delivered sooner than it would be possible via Sea Freight, then Air Freight is an option (although obviously more expensive).

</p>


<p>
Air freight is the quickest method of sending your goods overseas by far, usually taking 7-10 days on a full door to door move basis.
</p>

<p>Moving some items by air freight is ideal for those items you will require immediately at destination, allowing the remainder of your items to be sent by traditional shipping methods.
</p>
<p>Airlines charge on weight basis calculated from either the actual weight of the shipment, or a minimum weight calculated on a set weight to volume scale (which is 167kgs per cubic meter).
</p>
<p>Moving by airfreight is also ideal if you have a low volume or light weight shipment, with items that are important to your daily life and are needed pretty much as soon as you arrive at your destination.
</p>
<p>Although moving overseas by air freight is quick and efficient, it can amount to a more costly move. If you wish to save some cash then why not try moving overseas by sea fright.
</p>



<h6>MOVING CARS OVERSEAS
</h6> 


<h5>ATM World Wide Movers provides a high quality motor vehicle shipment service, which ensures the highest level of protection for your car during the international moving process.
</h5>


<h6>Depending on the age and value of your vehicle and your intended destination, it may be advisable to sell your car prior to moving. When moving cars overseas they are some things that you have to take into account. Some countries have stringent environmental requirements based on the vehicles age and distance travelled, while other countries impose import duties and other charges when importing any type of vehicle. Speak to us during your in home consultation service or over the phone.
</h6>
<h6>Regulations differ from one country to the next, so it is always best to discuss any vehicle shipping requirements with your ATM Relocation Coordinator as early as possible. They will then determine if it is possible and more importantly if it is an economical option for you to ship your car to the destination country.</h6>


 <h6>MOVING PIANOS OVERSEAS</h6>
<h5>How do I move my piano overseas?</h5>
<p>Piano's require extra special attention and we don't take any chances with them. We utilize only the very best piano carriers in the world.</p>

<p>Moving a piano overseas is generally not an issue, however some older piano's or antique piano's can have ivory keys that will attract the attention of Customs when the shipment arrives at the destination.
</p>


<p>To avoid any problems, it is wise to advise us if you are unsure of the background of the piano, or other musical instrument for that matter that was not newly purchased in the last few years.
</p>
<h6>MOVING WINE OVERSEAS</h6>
<h5>When moving wine overseas, ATM World Wide Movers use foam padding to securely store bottles of wine and spirits during the moving process. This ensures your valuable wine collection will arrive in the condition in which it left.</h5>

<p>In some countries there are strict rules regarding the importation of Alcohol, both from an import charge perspective, and also in some countries you require a permit to consume or store alcohol in any form.
</p>
<p>If you are moving wine overseas, taxes and import duty applies to alcohol, and some countries prohibit alcohol altogether, so please check with your country of destination customs officials to see if the wine (or any other alcohol) you are intending to ship will be accepted at your destination, and if so what local import charges may be applied.</p>



 
<h6>MOVING FINE ART AND ANTIQUES OVERSEAS</h6>
<h5>How do I move antiques and artwork overseas?</h5>
<h6>Moving fine art and antiques overseas is a delicate process. At ATM World Wide Movers we specialize in international moving of fragile personal items including fine art and antique furniture. Feel free to contact one of our move consultants to ask about your unique situation so that we can tailor a trouble free move for your valued items.</h6>

<h6>
What if my artwork or antique is made from timber, bamboo or other related products?</h6>
<p>The Department of Agriculture and Water Materials have a Biosecurity Import Conditions System (BICON) that outlines what is required to comply with the import and export of all imported timber, wooden articles, bamboo and related products (whether for commercial or personal use). It is the responsibility of importers to ensure that their products meet the import conditions. ATM World Wide Movers can assist you with ensuring your artwork and antiques meet the import conditions to avoid delays, additional costs, and, in some cases, the re-export or destruction of your goods.</p>

<h6>How is my artwork or antique protected from damage?</h6>
<p>Our crates and containers are lined with the required protective materials to ensure your artwork or antiques are carefully packed and protected from damage. We utilize polyethylene and polyurethane foams depending on the nature of the items being packed according to density, shock absorption vibration etc.</p>
<h6>Can I pack my own artwork or antiques when moving overseas?</h6>
<p>Incorrect packing, or the use of the wrong cushioning agents could potentially do more harm than good to your precious antiques. At ATM World Wide Movers, we determine the specific packing and cushioning requirements with relation to spacing, cushioning materials etc to protect your items. It is strongly recommended that you contact one of our experienced ATM packing experts before you begin packing and planning your move.
</p>

<h6>A word of warning regarding content of artwork (especially images, paintings and sculptures)</h6>
<p>Photographs, Movies, Magazines and even artwork or paintings that are legally available and acceptable in one country, may be regarded as pornographic and prohibited in another.</p>


<h6>Can I take my guns with me when I move overseas (real and ornamental) ?</h6>
<p>Moving firearms or weapons of any kind can be problematic, even if the items in question have been decommissioned and are approved in your country of origin. What you regard as a decorative antique might be considered an offensive weapon in another country. Should you have any concerns about items you are planning to move, it is best to consult an ATM Relocation Coordinator prior to shipping to prevent a potential weapon of any kind (eg firearm/dagger knife etc) from stopping an otherwise problem-free move or relocation.</p>
